	<h2>Taking DIY to the next level.</h2>
	<p>
	  For the longest time I've always wanted to know what was under the hood of things. 
	  Especially when it came to what's in my guitar rig. It's been more than 15 years 
	  of playing guitar, the past few I wanted to take it to the next level. Having a proper
	  pedalboard, quality pedals, and the right character was important! It took a lot of good
	  and fun research, which finally led to embracing the idea of really getting to know 
	  my pedals. Now I find myself sometimes curiously up until 3am working on more and more
	  pedals. 
	  What was an interest is now maybe an obession. So I'd like to share that Passion by taking in 
	  orders and some creations for fellow guitar and effects junkies.
	</p>

	<p>
	  My name is Andrew, and I simply love bringing a great pedal and pedalboards to life.
